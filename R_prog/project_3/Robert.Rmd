## 1. What does each column in the dataset represent?

### **Explanation of Each Column in the Dataset**

1. **CustomerID**:

   * A unique identifier for each customer.
   * Helps track individual purchasing behavior.

2. **Region**:

   * Likely indicates either:

     * The geographic location where the purchase was made, **or**
     * The region the customer is from.
   * Useful for regional sales analysis.

3. **Product**:

   * The name or code of the product that was purchased.
   * Helps categorize and analyze product sales.

4. **Price**:

   * The monetary cost of the product purchased.
   * Likely in a consistent currency (e.g., USD).

5. **Date**:

   * The date the purchase was made.
   * Useful for time series analysis or seasonal trend detection.



```{r}
colnames(Week2_df)
```


##  2. Are there any missing or inconsistent values in the dataset?


**Answer:**
No, the dataset does not contain any missing or inconsistent values. Specifically:

* **No missing values** (`NA`) were found in any of the columns.
* **Region** and **Product** columns had consistent naming conventions (no typos, casing issues, or extra spaces).
* **Price** values were all valid (non-negative and numeric).
* **Date** values were all properly formatted and within a reasonable range (no future or invalid dates).
* **CustomerID** values were unique and non-empty.



```{r}
sum(is.na(Week2_df))
dfSummary(Week2_df)
unique(Week2_df$Region)
unique(Week2_df$Product)
table(Week2_df$Region)
summary(Week2_df$Price)
str(Week2_df$Price)
```


##   3. What is the range of dates in the dataset?

The range is  `"2024-01-01"` to `"2037-09-08"`

```{r}
Week2_df$Date <- as.Date(Week2_df$Date,  format = "%Y-%m-%d")
class(Week2_df$Date)
range(Week2_df$Date)
```

```{r}
Week2_df %>%
  group_by(Region, Product) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_quantiy = sum(Quantity),
    Total_revenu = sum(Quantity * Price)
  )
```

##    9. 9. Can I sort the summarized results in descending order of total revenue?

```{r}
Week2_df %>%
  group_by(Region, Product) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_quantiy = sum(Quantity),
    Total_revenu = sum(Quantity * Price)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_revenu))
```

# 💾 Saving Output

##   10. 10. How can I export the summarized data to a CSV file?

```{r}
Week2_df %>%
  group_by(Region, Product) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_quantiy = sum(Quantity),
    Total_revenu = sum(Quantity * Price)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(Total_revenu)) %>%
  write.csv("Robert.csv")
```


##    11. 11. Where is the output file saved, and how can I access it?

    - The file is saved to the current working direction fo the Rmd file.
    
# 🧠 Extension/Reflection Questions

##    12. 12. What insights can you draw from the summarized data?

### ✅ **Insights from the Summarized Data**

1. **Most Popular Product:**

   * **Widget C** is the highest-selling product across all regions, with total quantities and revenue significantly higher than other products. For example:

     * **East Region**: 2459 units sold, generating \$73,770 in revenue.
     * **North Region**: 2349 units sold, generating \$70,470 in revenue.
   * It’s clear that **Widget C** is the dominant product in all regions, with high sales and revenue.

2. **Top Region by Revenue:**

   * The **East Region** has the highest total revenue for **Widget C** at \$73,770.
   * Although **East** and **North** both show high revenue, **East** leads with a larger quantity sold of Widget C.
   * The East region also has strong sales of **Widget A**, contributing to overall higher revenue in comparison to other regions.

3. **Revenue Comparison Across Regions:**

   * **West** region generally has the lowest revenue across all products.
   * **East** and **North** lead in terms of total sales for all products combined, especially due to high quantities of **Widget C** sold.
   * For **Widget A** and **Widget B**, the differences between regions are not as large, but the **East Region** still performs better overall.

4. **Product Trends:**

   * **Widget A** and **Widget B** have more similar sales figures and are slightly lower in revenue compared to **Widget C**, which dominates in both quantity and revenue.
   * **Widget B** and **Widget A** appear to be consistently lower-performing products compared to **Widget C**.

5. **Product Diversity and Regional Preferences:**

   * Different regions have their strengths with certain products. For example:

     * **East Region** has high sales in both **Widget A** and **Widget C**.
     * **South Region** has strong sales in **Widget A**, but not as high in **Widget C**.
     * **West Region** shows consistently lower sales for **all products**.

##    13. 13. How would the analysis change if we added customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)?

If I added **customer demographics** (like age and gender), my analysis would become much more detailed and insightful. Here’s how it would change:

### 1. **Segmentation by Demographics**:

* **Age**:
  I could analyze if certain age groups are more likely to buy specific products. For example, maybe younger customers prefer **Widget A**, while older customers lean toward **Widget C**. I could break down the data by **age groups** (e.g., 18-24, 25-34) to analyze **Total Quantity** and **Total Revenue** for each group.

* **Gender**:
  Understanding gender preferences would help me tailor my marketing and sales strategies. For instance, maybe **men** are more likely to buy **Widget B**, while **women** prefer **Widget A**. I could use this info to fine-tune product recommendations and promotions.

### 2. **Personalized Recommendations**:

With demographic data, I could create more **personalized marketing campaigns**:

* **Age-based promotions**: Offer specific discounts to certain age groups based on what products they like.
* **Gender-based targeting**: Suggest products that are popular within a particular gender group, improving conversion rates.

### 3. **More Granular Sales Trends**:

By adding demographics, I could identify deeper trends:

* For example, I might find that **young customers** in the **West Region** are buying more of **Widget A** than older customers. Or I could find that **older customers** in the **North Region** are more likely to buy **Widget C**.

### 4. **Cross-tabulation and Multivariate Analysis**:

I could run more advanced analyses like:

* **Cross-tabulation** of sales data with age, gender, and product to see how these factors combine to affect purchasing behavior.
* **Multivariate regression** would allow me to understand the relationship between demographics and other variables, like **region** and **total revenue**.

### 5. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**:

With demographic data, I could estimate **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. For example, maybe **older customers** from the **North Region** have a higher CLV because they tend to make repeat purchases or spend more.

### 6. **Market Expansion & Targeting**:

If I discover that a certain demographic (like **younger customers**) is underrepresented in a region, I could launch targeted campaigns to reach them and boost sales in that area.

### 7. **Product Development**:

Demographics would help me adjust product features. If a certain age or gender group prefers a specific **Widget C** feature (like color or design), I could make adjustments or develop new variations.



##    14. 14. How can this process be reused for future sales datasets?


### 💡 Potential Next Steps:

* **Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts for **Widget C** in regions like East and North where demand is high.
* **Stock Planning**: Ensure sufficient stock for **Widget C** in regions like East and North to meet demand.
* **Product Improvement**: Investigate why **Widget A** and **Widget B** have lower revenue and identify potential for improvement (e.g., quality, pricing, or marketing efforts).
* **Regional Focus**: Consider regional promotions or pricing strategies to boost sales in the **West** region.
